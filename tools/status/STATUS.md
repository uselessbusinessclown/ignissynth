## Drift detected

The dashboard noticed the following inconsistencies. None of these
block the build by themselves; CI decides which warrant a hard fail.

- proofs without explicit '; Verdict:' line: S-04-weave-log, S-07-form-runtime, S-09-synth-kernel, S-11-bridge-proto
- axioms on disk but not in manifest: A9-ignition-substrate
